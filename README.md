## Features:

- Header 
  - The Header displays the title of the game, using a salmon pink colour.

- The Game Area 
  - This section diplays the choice of either Rock, Paper or Scissors to go up against the computer.
  - Upon clicking the relavant action, the computer will also show what they have chosen. Whoever has won will receive a point. If both the player and the computer are to make the same choice, then no point shall be awarded.
  - This can be seen in the exmaple below. where we can see that the player won the game, as a they chose rock, whereas the computer chose scissors. "You have won!" is then displayed to confirm that the player has won that round.
